    "## Lecture: Week 1 - Introduction to Rule-Based Systems and Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the machine learning models we'll be using in this assignment, it's important to understand where these models fit in the broader context of AI. One of the earliest approaches to AI was the **Rule-Based System**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule-Based Systems in AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-Based Systems** are a form of AI where knowledge is encoded in the form of rules, often written as **if-then** statements. These systems rely on a predefined set of rules to make decisions or classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Rule-Based Systems Work:\n",
    "- A set of **rules** is created manually by domain experts.\n",
    "- Each rule follows the format:  \n",
    "  `IF condition THEN action`.\n",
    "- For example, a rule for a medical diagnosis system might look like this:  \n",
    "  `IF fever > 101°F AND cough = true THEN diagnosis = flu`.\n",
    "- The system checks each rule against the input data, and when a rule matches, the corresponding action or classification is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Rule-Based Systems:\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Rules are easy to understand and explain.\n",
    "- **Control**: The system's behavior is fully determined by the rules, giving precise control over outcomes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "However, Rule-Based Systems have some significant **limitations**:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Manually creating and managing a large number of rules is difficult.\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: Rule-based systems cannot easily adapt to new data or situations they weren't programmed for.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Transition to Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning models, in contrast to rule-based systems, do not rely on manually defined rules. Instead, they **learn patterns** from data. These models can generalize to new data and situations, making them more adaptable and scalable for complex tasks like classification, regression, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are focusing on training and evaluating three different machine learning models:\n",
    "1. **Random Forest**\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to understand how these models work, how they differ, and how to evaluate their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by reviewing the key concepts behind each model, followed by an explanation of how they make predictions, and then wrap up with a discussion of model evaluation techniques, specifically accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method, which means it combines multiple models (in this case, decision trees) to improve performance. The core idea behind Random Forest is **bagging**, where multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the data, and their predictions are averaged to give the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Random Forest Works:\n",
    "1. **Random Sampling**: The algorithm creates multiple decision trees by randomly sampling data points (with replacement) from the training dataset.\n",
    "2. **Random Feature Selection**: Each tree is built using a random subset of features, making each tree slightly different.\n",
    "3. **Prediction**: For classification tasks, the majority vote from all the trees is taken as the final prediction. For regression tasks, the average prediction is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                Training Data\n",
    "                      |\n",
    "                ----------------------\n",
    "                |        |        |    |\n",
    "              Tree 1   Tree 2   Tree 3  ...\n",
    "                |        |        |  \n",
    "      Prediction 1  Prediction 2  Prediction 3\n",
    "                |        |        |\n",
    "            Majority Vote / Averaging\n",
    "                      |\n",
    "                Final Prediction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Random Forest:\n",
    "- Handles both classification and regression problems.\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting due to the averaging of multiple trees.\n",
    "- Automatically handles missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Parameters:\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of each tree.\n",
    "- `max_features`: The number of features considered for splitting at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It is used when the dependent variable is categorical, i.e., the output belongs to one of two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Logistic Regression Works:\n",
    "1. **Linear Combination**: Logistic regression takes a linear combination of input features:  \n",
    "   \\( z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n \\)\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Function**: It then applies the **sigmoid function** to the result to obtain a probability score between 0 and 1.  \n",
    "   sigma(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))\n",
    "3. **Decision Boundary**: A threshold (typically 0.5) is applied to classify the outcome as either class 0 or class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "               Features (X1, X2, ..., Xn)\n",
    "                     |\n",
    "        Linear Combination: z = w0 + w1*X1 + w2*X2 + ...\n",
    "                     |\n",
    "              Sigmoid Function: σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n",
    "                     |\n",
    "             Probability: 0 ≤ P ≤ 1\n",
    "                     |\n",
    "            Threshold (0.5):  P > 0.5 → Class 1\n",
    "                             P ≤ 0.5 → Class 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- Simple and fast to train.\n",
    "- Interpretable model (coefficients can be interpreted as the importance of each feature).\n",
    "- Works well for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Parameters:\n",
    "- `penalty`: Regularization term to prevent overfitting (L1, L2).\n",
    "- `C`: Inverse of regularization strength (smaller values specify stronger regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are powerful classification algorithms that aim to find the **best separating hyperplane** between different classes. The idea is to maximize the **margin** between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How SVM Works:\n",
    "1. **Hyperplane**: SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes. The points that lie closest to the hyperplane are called **support vectors**.\n",
    "2. **Maximizing the Margin**: The goal is to maximize the distance between the support vectors of each class and the hyperplane.\n",
    "3. **Kernel Trick**: For non-linearly separable data, SVM can transform the input space using a kernel function (e.g., polynomial, RBF) to make the data linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram: SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        +                                +            ← Class 1\n",
    "                      (Support Vector)      \n",
    "        +                    |                   +\n",
    "              ----------- Hyperplane ------------\n",
    "                              |\n",
    "         (Support Vector)                ← Class 0\n",
    "        o                                o        \n",
    "        o          o                     o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of SVM:\n",
    "- Works well for high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Effective in cases where the number of features is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Can be used for both classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Parameters:\n",
    "- `C`: Regularization parameter, controls trade-off between achieving a low error on training data and minimizing the margin.\n",
    "- `kernel`: Defines the type of hyperplane used (linear, RBF, polynomial).\n",
    "- `gamma`: Kernel coefficient for RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will evaluate the models using **accuracy**, which is a common metric for classification tasks. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy is useful, it may not be ideal when dealing with imbalanced datasets (where one class has significantly more instances than the other). In such cases, other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score are more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will train and evaluate Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM models on a dataset. By comparing their accuracy, you will gain insight into how different machine learning algorithms perform on the same problem and understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key to mastering these models lies in experimenting with the hyperparameters and understanding how each model works under different conditions. Pay close attention to the differences in performance, especially when tweaking parameters such as `n_estimators`, `C`, and `kernel`.\n",
