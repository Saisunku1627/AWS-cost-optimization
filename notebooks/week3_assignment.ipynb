        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, we focus on two essential pathfinding algorithms: **A\\*** Search and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Both algorithms are widely used for solving graph-based pathfinding problems, such as finding the shortest path in a maze. While BFS explores all nodes level by level to find the shortest path, A\\* Search improves efficiency by using a heuristic to estimate the cost to the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **What is A\\* Search?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**A\\* Search** is a more efficient graph traversal algorithm compared to BFS, and it is often used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It uses both the actual distance from the start node and a heuristic (an estimate of the remaining distance) to guide its search toward the goal. This heuristic makes A\\* more efficient than BFS in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts:\n",
        "- **g(n)**: The cost from the start node to the current node \\(n\\).\n",
        "- **h(n)**: The heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node \\(n\\) to the goal node.\n",
        "- **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**: The total cost function, where \\(f(n)\\) is the sum of the known cost and the estimated cost to the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "A\\* Search is optimal when using an **admissible** heuristic, meaning the heuristic never overestimates the true cost to the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How A\\* Works:\n",
        "1. Initialize the **open set** with the start node.\n",
        "2. For each node in the open set, calculate the total cost \\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\), where \\(g(n)\\) is the cost to reach that node and \\(h(n)\\) is the heuristic estimate to the goal.\n",
        "3. Explore the node with the lowest \\(f(n)\\), adding its neighbors to the open set.\n",
        "4. Repeat until the goal node is reached or the open set is empty.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A\\* Search Diagram\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",

        "Start → [Node1, Node2, Node3] → Calculate f(n) → Explore Node with Lowest f(n)\n",
        "```\n",

        "A\\* tries to minimize both the actual cost \\(g(n)\\) and the estimated cost \\(h(n)\\) to the goal, allowing it to find the shortest path more efficiently than BFS in most cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Heuristic Functions:\n",
        "A good heuristic can drastically improve the efficiency of A\\*. Some common heuristics include:\n",
        "- **Manhattan Distance**: For grid-based environments where you can only move up, down, left, or right, the Manhattan distance is \\( h(n) = |x_{goal} - x_{current}| + |y_{goal} - y_{current}| \\).\n",
        "- **Euclidean Distance**: For environments where diagonal movement is allowed, the Euclidean distance is \\( h(n) = \\sqrt{(x_{goal} - x_{current})^2 + (y_{goal} - y_{current})^2} \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Advantages of A\\* Search:\n",
        "- **Optimality**: A\\* is guaranteed to find the shortest path as long as the heuristic is admissible (it never overestimates).\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: The heuristic guides the search, often reducing the number of nodes explored compared to BFS.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is Breadth-First Search (BFS)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "While A\\* Search uses a heuristic to optimize the pathfinding process, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** explores all possible paths equally and is most useful in **unweighted graphs** where all edges have the same cost (like a simple maze).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts:\n",
        "- **Queue**: BFS uses a **queue** to explore nodes level by level, meaning it visits all neighbors of the current node before moving on to their neighbors.\n",
        "- **Shortest Path Guarantee**: BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the same distance before moving further away from the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How BFS Works:\n",
        "1. Start from the initial node (e.g., the start of the maze).\n",
        "2. Add the initial node to the queue and mark it as visited.\n",
        "3. Repeatedly remove a node from the front of the queue and check all of its neighbors:\n",
        "   - If a neighbor has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n",
        "4. Repeat this process until the goal node is found or all nodes are explored.\n",

        "#### Advantages of BFS:\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: BFS is easy to implement and understand.\n",
        "- **Guarantee of Shortest Path**: In unweighted graphs, BFS will always find the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n",
