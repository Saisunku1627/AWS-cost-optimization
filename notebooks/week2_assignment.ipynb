        "\n",
        "In this week’s assignment, we will focus on an important concept in **reinforcement learning (RL)**: **Epsilon Decay**. This is especially relevant for exploration in RL algorithms like **Q-Learning** and **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**. The goal is to understand the role of epsilon decay in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off.\n",

        "### 1. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**\n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions to maximize cumulative rewards. It involves the following key components:\n",
        "- **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.\n",
        "- **Environment**: The world through which the agent interacts.\n",
        "- **State (s)**: The current situation of the agent.\n",
        "- **Action (a)**: The decisions the agent makes.\n",
        "- **Reward (r)**: The feedback from the environment after an action.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent aims to learn an **optimal policy** that maximizes the total reward over time by balancing two conflicting strategies:\n",
        "- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover more information about the environment.\n",
        "- **Exploitation**: Using known actions that give the highest reward based on the current knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "In RL, one common approach to balance exploration and exploitation is the **epsilon-greedy** strategy:\n",
        "- With probability **epsilon** (𝜖), the agent chooses a random action (exploration).\n",
        "- With probability **1 - epsilon**, the agent chooses the action that maximizes the known reward (exploitation).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How Epsilon Decay Works:\n",
        "- **Initial Exploration**: At the start, **epsilon** is usually set to a high value (close to 1), so the agent explores a lot of different actions.\n",
        "- **Decay Over Time**: As the agent learns more about the environment, **epsilon** gradually decreases, encouraging the agent to exploit the best-known actions more frequently.\n",

        "\n",
        "A common method to control the decay of epsilon over episodes is using the **exponential decay function**:\n",
        "\n",
        "epsilon = epsilon_min + (epsilon_max - epsilon_min) * exp(-lambda * episode)\n",

        "- lambda: The decay rate that controls how fast epsilon decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Parameters:\n",
        "- **Episode**: A single run of the agent through the environment.\n",
        "- **Epsilon**: The exploration probability.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation Trade-Off**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **exploration-exploitation trade-off** is central to reinforcement learning:\n",
        "- **Exploration**: Helps the agent discover new, potentially better actions.\n",
        "- **Exploitation**: Allows the agent to leverage what it has already learned to maximize rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Balancing these two is critical:\n",
        "- **Too much exploration**: The agent may waste time on suboptimal actions.\n",
        "- **Too much exploitation**: The agent may get stuck in local optima and fail to discover better strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Epsilon decay helps the agent gradually shift from exploration (early in training) to exploitation (as the policy becomes more refined).\n",

        "### 5. **CartPole Environment**\n",
        "Before diving into the **MountainCar** environment, let's explore the **CartPole** environment, another classic problem in reinforcement learning. In CartPole:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The agent controls a cart that can move left or right on a one-dimensional track.\n",
        "- A pole is attached to the cart by an un-actuated joint. The goal is to prevent the pole from falling over by balancing it upright.\n",
        "- The agent receives a reward for each time step that the pole remains upright.\n",
        "\n",
        "CartPole is an excellent environment for understanding basic reinforcement learning concepts because it provides quick feedback and demonstrates the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation. Using the epsilon-greedy strategy with epsilon decay can significantly impact the agent's ability to learn a successful balancing policy.\n",

        "- The goal is for the agent (a car) to reach the top of a hill.\n",
        "- The agent must learn to balance momentum and use exploration to figure out how to build enough velocity to climb the hill.\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenge in MountainCar is that the agent must explore enough actions (like driving backward before moving forward) to find an optimal strategy. This makes **epsilon-greedy** and **epsilon decay** crucial for solving the problem efficiently.\n",
