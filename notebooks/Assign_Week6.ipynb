    "- Identify number of optimum clusters, and justify how do you picked the optimum number of clusters (1 pts)\n",
    "- Visually present clusters in an informative manner (1 pts)\n",
    "- Summarize your findings.  Be sure to include insights in the clusters or grouping of the post types. For example, do different clusters tend to have different themes, sentiment, common words, etc. (2 pts)\n",
